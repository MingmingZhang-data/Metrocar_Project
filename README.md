# Metrocar_Project

Project Overview: Funnel Analysis Mastery Project
This project aims to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar, a ride-sharing app (similar to Uber/Lyft), to identify areas for improvement and optimization. I  used SQL for data collection and Pandas for further analysis and visualisation. The stakeholders have asked several business questions that can uncover valuable insights for improving specific areas of the customer funnel. My task was to conduct a funnel analysis and present my analysis and recommendation.
